## Engineering Notes
1) Started with an approximate motor model to design a stable controller.
2) Verified open-loop limitations (slow response, poor tracking).
3) Designed PID and validated closed-loop tracking.
4) Added load disturbance to test disturbance rejection.
5) Converted controller to discrete-time (Ts = 0.01 s) to match embedded reality.
6) Added actuator saturation and observed performance limits.
7) Added anti-windup compensation to prevent integrator windup under saturation.
